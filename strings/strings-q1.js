HW2: Strings Q1: compute all mnemonics for a phone number

Given a 4 digit telephone number, print all possible combinations of letters that each number could represent.
How does it work? Look at your keypad on you phone. These are the mappings:
    '2': 'abc',
    '3': 'def',
    '4': 'ghi',
    '5': 'jkl',
    '6': 'mno',
    '7': 'pqrs',
    '8': 'tuv',
    '9': 'wxyz',

Thus say if we have only two digit numbers, and the telephone number is 23, then the possible combinations are:
ad
ae
af
bd
be
bf
cd
ce
cf
