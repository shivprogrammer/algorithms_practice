// MST - PRIMS ALOGRITHM
there is no formulation of paths, all you need to do is connect everything, and find the cheapest paths.

Dijkstra's Alogirthm
You're going to do a graph, and this graph is something where the edges of it have weights.

// when all the weights are 1, there is a BFS
Each node actually has a value

heap is an implementation of a priority queue
avial trees or red band(?) trees that can be more easily balanced.
