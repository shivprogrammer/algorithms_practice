Hey man. I have to say, life is really fucking good when you just are on top of your shit.

I'm alive and loooooooovvvvvinnnn the puddy but more than anything else, I've never felt so good in my fucking life because I'm really building towards my future. I love these little problems and algorithm puzzles. Honestly, they are awesome little challeneges that I'll get to do for the rest of my life if I choose so. And what's even better? The better that I get at these, the more money I get paid.

I'm so happy man. I'm so fucking blessed. Life is so beautiful, and I couldn't be more grateful. Of course, I have a long way to go and there is still tremendous pain that needs to be overcome, but I'm busting my fucking ass and getting so much better every single day. It's really beautiful.

Also, just TODAY!!!
I learned:
  How to really use the map, filter, and reduce functions.
  MERGE SORT, that sexy little sorting function.

The problem is that I've been avoiding doing all of the front end work for Brian, and now is the time that I really need to get into that and make sure that i receive my certificate. That is the most important priority right now. In addition, I've learned so much and going through all of that angular shit will really be quite helpful and should move relatively smoothly.

I can keep this here because the more commits that I do, the better my little git graph looks and honestly, all of this note taking really keeps my sharp as to what I need to do and what moves to make. I was born to be a writer, I just now get the privilege of writing in multiple languages.

BTW THIS FUCKING MATRIX SHIT AND THE POWER MODE FINALLY FIGURED OUT IS FUCKINNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGG AMAZING. GOD DAMN I'M GOING TO BE CODING SOOOOOO MUCH MORE BECAUSE OF THIS SHIT.

At this point, it's important to note that similarly to project week, right now I need fucking results and as fast as possible. I'm NOT HERE TO LEARN. Get the shit done, be fucking efficient, and move as quickly as fucking possible. Learn later. There's too much at stake right now.

Giant Curve Ball.
My grade dropped 5% because of my shit contributions on the final project. I'm standing at a 77% right now.

That means I have to get up 10% in one day.

QUESTIONS:
I attended literally every single class, why is my attendance grade at a 90.91% instead of 100%?
Dude. Seriously. 25/50 on my final project.
I worked my ass off on something that was going to make it all so much profound and excellent. I'm being punished for chasing excellence just because I assumed that my group would have felt that my individual success would mean our overall success? This is ridiculous man.

// go work out asshole, you're way too fucking pissed off right now. And you've been doing work all day, it'll be good to take an 1.5 hour break and burn some steam off.

A 10/10 on the last three assignments I didn't do will only put me up 3 more percent. That means I have to get those done.
Interesting note, perhaps the gentleman is still awake. My attendance grade went back to 100. Helpful at least.

Pretty much the whole front end I ate shit on. Probably explains why I really couldn't contribute during project week. I was just a dipshit.

Also, no the fucking attendance wasn't a 100. It's at 90.91, which I need to talk to this fucker about because that's seriously a load of fucking bullshit.

Turning in the professional pitch and the first draft of the resume puts me up another 1.05%.
Hell, I could fucking get over a 90 even with the drawback. Frustrating, but never debilitating. Time to just go beast mode.

Have to get the grade up another 4+ percent in 18 hours. Plenty of time.
