Hey man. I have to say, life is really fucking good when you just are on top of your shit.

I'm alive and loooooooovvvvvinnnn the puddy but more than anything else, I've never felt so good in my fucking life because I'm really building towards my future. I love these little problems and algorithm puzzles. Honestly, they are awesome little challeneges that I'll get to do for the rest of my life if I choose so. And what's even better? The better that I get at these, the more money I get paid.

I'm so happy man. I'm so fucking blessed. Life is so beautiful, and I couldn't be more grateful. Of course, I have a long way to go and there is still tremendous pain that needs to be overcome, but I'm busting my fucking ass and getting so much better every single day. It's really beautiful.

Also, just TODAY!!!
I learned:
  How to really use the map, filter, and reduce functions.
  MERGE SORT, that sexy little sorting function.

The problem is that I've been avoiding doing all of the front end work for Brian, and now is the time that I really need to get into that and make sure that i receive my certificate. That is the most important priority right now. In addition, I've learned so much and going through all of that angular shit will really be quite helpful and should move relatively smoothly.

I can keep this here because the more commits that I do, the better my little git graph looks and honestly, all of this note taking really keeps my sharp as to what I need to do and what moves to make. I was born to be a writer, I just now get the privilege of writing in multiple languages.

BTW THIS FUCKING MATRIX SHIT AND THE POWER MODE FINALLY FIGURED OUT IS FUCKINNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGG AMAZING. GOD DAMN I'M GOING TO BE CODING SOOOOOO MUCH MORE BECAUSE OF THIS SHIT.
