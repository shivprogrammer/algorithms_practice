Never, ever, ever give up.

Why? When you move honestly, and do everything from the heart, the universe complies.

Today is a prime example of that. And what happened? Ended up being a complete blessing in disguise.

Every single thing happens for a reason, and all I have to do is find the reasons within myself. Go out there, and work your ass off.

Every experience of my life has made me ready.
