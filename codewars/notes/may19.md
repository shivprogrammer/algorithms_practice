Never, ever, ever give up.

Why? When you move honestly, and do everything from the heart, the universe complies.

Today is a prime example of that. And what happened? Ended up being a complete blessing in disguise.

Every single thing happens for a reason, and all I have to do is find the reasons within myself. Go out there, and work your ass off.

Every experience of my life has made me ready. And that is exactly why when it comes to crunch time, I've trained so hard that I know exactly what to do.

You never rise to the level of your hopes, you fall to the level of your training

Never stop, never settle.

I will continue to fail. And with every failure, I grow.

And I will make myself the best person that I can be, so that I can make the world a better place.
